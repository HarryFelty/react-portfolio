                    <p> I am a full-stack web developer. About a year ago I graduated from Penn State with a B.S. is cybersecurity. Since then, I have worked in
                        IT and obtained a number of certifications. I was recently introduced to programming and found that I
                        greatly enjoy it. After spending some time self-learning and exploring the field, I decided to join a bootcamp
                        to help hone my skills. I attended the edX bootcamp through the University of Pennsylvania. The bootcamp taught me many technologies that are used
                        in full-stack development. As I continue to grow as a developer and perfect the skills I have already learned, I am looking for a fulfilling career
                        as a full-stack web developer. </p>
